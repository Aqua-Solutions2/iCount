# CODE ARCHIVED
**This project is no longer maintained. We are not going to upate this code anymore.**

# iCount
iCount is a counting bot. It will help keep your server alive when it's not that active anymore. It is also a nice minigame to have in your server.

## Suggestions, bugs, feature requests

Want to contribute? Great, we love that! Please take your time on [opening a new issue](https://github.com/SiebeBaree/iCount/issues/new).

## How to use the bot?

Invite the bot into your server(s) and give the bot enough perms to send and delete messages. After this just type `c!help` in one of the channels.

## Self-hosting
You can self-host this bot, but we will not give you any support. You will have to do everything yourself.

Some things you will have to setup:
* Python 3.8 or higher
* Pip 2.0 or higher
* An MySQL database set up
* discordpy 1.7 or higher
* mysql-connector-python 8.0 or higher
